# Text Cleaning Pipeline  

## 📌 Introduction  
This project implements a **text cleaning pipeline** using **four Python filters** connected through **command-line pipes (`|`)** to **process and enhance text data step by step**.  

### Features:  
✅ **Sentence Splitting** → Detects `.`, `!`, `?` and splits text into sentences  
✅ **Stopword Removal** → Removes common words like `the, is, in, at, which, on`  
✅ **Spell Correction** → Automatically fixes spelling errors (`teh → the`, `recieve → receive`)  
✅ **Sentence Capitalization** → Ensures the first letter of each sentence is capitalized
